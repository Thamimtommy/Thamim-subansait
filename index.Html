<h2>1.0<b><strong> About</strong></b></h2> 

<p><b>Hi everyone,</b>I'm <b>thamim</b> from <b>coimbatore</b>. I was born on<b> 07.12.2004.</b>I love to learn something about <b>computer</b> and <b>music,</b> <b>software,</b> <b>Space.</b> When I was a child I had dream that I was in a space station with some other crew members working on rocket software systems. Now I feel like I can acheive my dream very soon within 30 years. We always have many dreams but We can't achieve all of those, So take what you like the most.
so here I love to represent my hometown in detail. Coimbatore is the manchester of Tamil Nadu. It is also known as<b> Hardware capital of Tamil Nadu</b> in many places.<b><ins>4th Best cosmopolitan city of Tamil Nadu.</ins></b>Coimbatore got the god grace by the freshwater fall Which is located in Coimbatore and It is called<b>"Siruvani".</b> It is the world's second sweetest water of all time. I love my Identity and I love my Tamil language.</p>

<h2>2.0<b> Skills</b></h2> 

<p>I'm learning software developing at <strong>the top saas company</strong> called"<b>Freshwork".</b> I'm pretty sure that I will be a good software engineer.I learn <b>sound designing,</b><b> sound production,</b><b> music producer.</b>I listed the digital audio workstation I work</p>


<h2><strong>2.1 music skill</strong></h2>
<p>I learn to <b>producer music</b> by my own. I watch <b>youtube tutorial</b> how to make music and it took me <b>4 years to learn</b> the basic thing and to develop my knowledge to intermidiate level. It was not that easy to learn. In music there are some theory. Which is so Important to implement. I always think If I have mentor, Then I will learn the music really quick but unfortunately i didn't have a mentor. I produced more than a one beat per day. I worked freelance in<b>"Freelancer.com"</b>and I earned about 20k money in it. I brought my first guitar in my life. I was so happy to play with my guitar. I would rate my guitar skill as a beginner.

<h2>4.0<strong> Major genre</strong></h2>

<h3><b>Hip hop:</b></h3>
<p>Hip-Hop is a type of musical genre that has been around since the late '70s and early '80s. It started off underground but reached mainstream when NWA came out in 1987 with their debut album. Since then the genre has gotten a bad rap for it only being about drugs, violence, and misogynistic themes since those songs only get radio play and popularity, But this is not true, and i know this is a fact by doing research and listening to enough of the genre.
What real hip-hop is (at least to what my definition of real hip-hop is) music that discusses real life things such as social issues, politics, ones own life, knowledge and other important things along with fun party songs that are not radio and new which always has been about from the beginning. Other than it being a great genre with the topics I listed, it is great for it's use of rhymes, metaphors, poetry in general, flow, and knowledge on certain things mostly the community you grew up in. Poetry in musical form is one of the most genius ideas that I have ever heard and made me get into poetry. When I was pre-17,
I judged hip-hop from what I've heard on the radio but when I came across old school 'hip-hop and underground hip-hop, I had a change in my mind and became one of my favorite musical genres
